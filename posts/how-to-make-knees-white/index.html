Recommendations for watching anime you can. There are many different types of anime that can be enjoyed, so it really depends on what you&rsquo;re looking for in an anime. While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
