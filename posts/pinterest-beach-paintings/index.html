Recommendations for watching anime you can. There are many different types of anime that can be enjoyed, so it really depends on what you&rsquo;re looking for in an anime.

-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=hand-painted-a-clock-to-match-the-mickey-mouse-beach-paintings-i-did>Hand Painted A Clock To Match The Mickey Mouse Beach Paintings I Did<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hand-painted-a-clock-to-match-the-mickey-mouse-beach-paintings-i-did>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c5/a4/cd/c5a4cd55e0cbdb33dba732e275377697.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.f1ytdgBh_u_qeoRSLUsdWwHaJ3&pid=15.1"' alt="Hand painted a clock to match the Mickey Mouse beach paintings I did"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Cool wallpapers for different devices:
